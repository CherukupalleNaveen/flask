# Sample Flask Projects

This repository contains example Flask projects located in the `examples` directory. These projects are intended to help users quickly try out different Flask features and configurations.

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through installing Flask, setting up your environment, and creating a basic Flask application.

### Prerequisites

* **Python:** Flask is a Python micro web framework. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **pip:** pip is the package installer for Python. It usually comes bundled with Python installations. You can check if you have it by running `pip --version` in your terminal.

### Installation

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):** It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment for each Flask project to isolate its dependencies. This prevents conflicts between different projects.

    ```bash
    # On macOS and Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    Once activated, your terminal prompt will likely be prefixed with `(venv)`.

2.  **Install Flask:** With your virtual environment activated, you can install Flask using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

    You can verify the installation by checking the Flask version:

    ```bash
    pip show Flask
    ```

### Creating Your First Flask Application

1.  **Navigate to Your Desired Directory:** Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Flask application.

2.  **Create the Application File:** Create a new Python file (e.g., `app.py`) and open it in a text editor.

3.  **Write Basic Flask Code:** Add the following minimal Flask application code to your `app.py` file:

    ```python
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return '<p>Hello, World!</p>'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

    * `from flask import Flask`: Imports the Flask class.
    * `app = Flask(__name__)`: Creates an instance of the Flask application. `__name__` is a special Python variable that represents the name of the current module.
    * `@app.route('/')`: This is a decorator that defines a route. It tells Flask what URL should trigger the function below it. In this case, the `/` URL (the root of the application) will trigger the `hello_world` function.
    * `def hello_world():`: This is the view function associated with the `/` route. It returns the string `'<p>Hello, World!</p>'`, which will be displayed in the user's browser.
    * `if __name__ == '__main__':`: This ensures that the development server starts only when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module).
    * `app.run(debug=True)`: This starts the Flask development server. The `debug=True` option enables debugging mode, which provides helpful error messages and automatically reloads the server when you make code changes. **Do not use `debug=True` in production.**

4.  **Run the Development Server:** Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing your `app.py` file, and run the application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    You should see output indicating that the Flask development server has started, usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open this URL in your web browser, and you should see the "Hello, World!" message.

5.  **Stop the Development Server:** Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal to stop the development server.

### Creating More Routes and Views

You can define more routes and views in your Flask application. For example, to create a route that displays a greeting with a name:

1.  **Modify `app.py`:** Add the following code to your `app.py` file:

    ```python
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return '<p>Hello, World!</p>'

    @app.route('/hello/<name>')
    def hello(name):
        return f'<h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

    * `@app.route('/hello/<name>')`: This route has a dynamic part `<name>`. Whatever you put after `/hello/` in the URL will be passed as an argument to the `hello` function.
    * `def hello(name):`: This view function takes the `name` from the URL as an argument and uses an f-string to create a personalized greeting.

2.  **Run the Development Server:** If it's not already running, start the server again:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3.  **Access the New Route:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello/YourName` (replace `YourName` with your actual name). You should see the personalized greeting.

### Exploring the Examples

The `examples` directory in this repository contains several sample Flask applications. You can explore these projects to see different Flask features and project structures in action.

To run an example Flask application:

1.  Navigate into the specific example directory (e.g., `cd examples/sample_flask_app_1`).
2.  Ensure you have Flask installed in your virtual environment (as described in the Installation section). Some examples might have a `requirements.txt` file. If so, it's recommended to install the specific dependencies for that example:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Look for the main application file (usually named `app.py` or a similar name) and run it:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4.  Access the application in your web browser, usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

Feel free to examine the code, modify it, and experiment with these examples to deepen your understanding of Flask.
